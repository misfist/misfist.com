Enhances the featured image data returned on the post object by the REST API to include urls for all available sizes and other useful image data.

== Description ==

The REST API returns a `featured_image` field on the post object by default, but this field is simply the image ID.

This plugin adds a `better_featured_image` field to the post object that contains the available image sizes and urls, allowing you to get this information without making a second request.

It takes this:

`
"featured_image": 13,
`

And turns it into this:

`
"featured_image": 13,
"better_featured_image": {
    "id": 13,
    "alt_text": "Hot Air Balloons",
    "caption": "The event featured hot air balloon rides",

The format of the response is nearly identical to what you would get sending a request to `/wp-json/wp/v2/media/13`.

I've done some basic performance tests that indicate the difference in response times with and without this plugin to be about 10-15ms for a collection of 10 posts and 0-5ms for a single post. For me this is much faster than making a second request to `/media/`, especially for multiple posts.

This plugin is on [on Github](https://github.com/BraadMartin/better-rest-api-featured-images "Better REST API Featured Images") and pull requests are always welcome. :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

The WP REST API includes a filter on the response data it returns, and this plugin uses that filter to add a new field `better_featured_image` with the extra data for the featured image.

= When does the plugin load? =

The plugin loads on `init` at priority 12, in order to come after any custom post types have been registered.

= Why doesn't the plugin replace the default `featured_image` field? =

The `featured_image` field is a core field, and other applications might expect it to always be an integer value. To avoid any issues, this plugin includes the extra data under the `better_featured_image` field name.
