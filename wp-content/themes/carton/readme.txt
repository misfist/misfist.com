== ABOUT CARTON ==

Create a truly unique design with Carton, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme built using jQuery Masonry. Use the new Theme Options customizer to add own header image, custom background, column width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress & BuddyPress. Created using SASS and Compass. Uses Google Fonts for improved typeface readability and works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/carton/.

== NOTES ==

* By default, the full width of the site when viewing a single post/page is 1220px. The main content area on these pages is three times the column width set in the theme options.
* Carton only has one widgetized sidebar on the left which also contains your site title, description and nav menu. That is by design.
